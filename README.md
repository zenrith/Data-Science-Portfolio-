# Data Science Portfolio
A repository containing all my personal data science projects. You can find the Python .ipynb notebooks and R .Rmd files here. You may also visit [here](https://rpubs.com/zenrith) for my R portfolio.

They're a variety of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning Projects. I'll indicate the type of project I'm doing under each link below.

Hope you can take something away from them!

## Python
- [Suicide And Economy](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Suicide%20And%20Economy/Suicide%20And%20Economy.ipynb): All societies have different problems. When things go wrong, some people end it for themselves. How does this phenomenon vary from society to society? FYI this was the first project I did so it might look a little rougher than the other projects
  - EDA, Linear regression
- [Carousell Analytics](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Carousell%20Analytics/Carousell%20Analytics.ipynb): Ever wondered how Carousell is performing at a certain point in time? How would we know without a dataset? We create our own!
  - EDA, Web scraping, Regression  
- [Fake News Detection](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/tree/main/Fake%20News%20Detection): In a modernizing society that rapidly generates content online, can we accurately tell fake from true news apart? This was a project from my school's Machine Learning class, NUS CS3244. My partner and I was in charge of doing the preparation / cleaning / modelling of data. Personally, I handled the modelling that involved TFIDF vectorization, while my partner did modelling that involved Word2Vec. 
  - EDA, Text Classification
- [Cats And Dogs](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Cats%20And%20Dogs/Cats%20And%20Dogs.ipynb): One of the first few image classification models I made for an old Kaggle Challenge. Credits to [DeepLearningAI's CNN in TensorFlow course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow) for teaching me the ropes.
  - Binary image Classification
- [Horses vs Humans](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Horses%20vs%20Humans/Horses%20vs%20Humans.ipynb): My first transfer learning project! Credits to [DeepLearningAI's CNN in TensorFlow course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow) for teaching me the ropes.
  - Transfer Learning
- [Hand Signs](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Hand%20signs/Hand%20Signs.ipynb): Automatically distinguish handsigns from one another. Credits to [DeepLearningAI's CNN in TensorFlow course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow) for teaching me the ropes.
  - Multiclass image classification

## R 
- [Retail Trends](https://rpubs.com/zenrith/Retail_Trends): Can we see how a particular retail company is doing across the globe? The dataset is from my Data Visualization class. The analyses presented are a mix of what I've done in class and an addition of my take on exploring the data.
  - EDA
- [Cars Correlation](https://rpubs.com/zenrith/Cars_Correlation): If I wanted a car that was out of stock at the moment, could I find the next best alternative without knowing how to judge a car? 
  - Dimensionality reduction
