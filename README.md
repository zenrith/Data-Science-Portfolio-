# Data Science Portfolio
A repository containing all the data science projects completed by me thus far in academic and self-learning settings. Hope you can take something away from them!

## Python

- [Carousell Analytics](docs/Carousell Analytics.ipynb): Ever wondered how Carousell is performing at a certain point in time? How would we know without a dataset? We create our own!
  - Techniques: Web scraping, Data cleaning, Data manipulation, Data visualization, Regression Modelling
- [Fake News Detection](): In a modernizing society that rapidly generates content online, can we accurately tell fake from true news apart?
