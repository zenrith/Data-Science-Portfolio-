# Data Science Portfolio
A repository containing all my personal data science projects

Most, if not all, will contain some form of data cleaning, manipulation, visualization. Under each project, I'll just include techniques that separate ones one project from the other. If no additional techinques are included, then it's safe to assume that it's pretty must just cleaning, manipulation and visualization. 

Hope you can take something away from them!

## Python
- [Suicide And Economy](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Suicide%20And%20Economy/Suicide%20And%20Economy.ipynb): All societies have different problems. When things go wrong, some people end it for themselves. How does this phenomenon vary from society to society? FYI this was the first project I did so it might look a little rougher than the other projects
  - Techniques: Prediction using linear regression
- [Carousell Analytics](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Carousell%20Analytics/Carousell%20Analytics.ipynb): Ever wondered how Carousell is performing at a certain point in time? How would we know without a dataset? We create our own!
  - Techniques: Web scraping, Regression RMSE comparison 
- [Fake News Detection](): In a modernizing society that rapidly generates content online, can we accurately tell fake from true news apart?
  - Techniques:
