# Data Science Portfolio
A repository containing all my personal data science projects. You can find the Python .ipynb notebooks and R .Rmd files here. You may also visit [here](https://rpubs.com/zenrith) for my R projects.

They're a variety of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning Projects. Under each project, I've tagged the type of work that's been done so that'll help with picking what you'd like to see.

Hope you can take something away from them!

## Analytics
###### Here you can find my EDA projects which usually refers to me doing Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, Manipulation, Visualization to answer some of my questions. They may be conducted in either Python / R / both. 
- [Suicide And Economy](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Suicide%20And%20Economy/Suicide%20And%20Economy.ipynb): All societies have different problems. When things go wrong, some people end it for themselves. How does this phenomenon vary from society to society? FYI this was the first project I did so it might look a little rougher than the other projects
  - Python, Linear regression
- [Carousell Analytics](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Carousell%20Analytics/Carousell%20Analytics.ipynb): Ever wondered how Carousell is performing at a certain point in time? How would we know without a dataset? We create our own!
  - Python, Web scraping, Regression  
- [Retail Trends](https://rpubs.com/zenrith/Retail_Trends): Can we see how a particular retail company is doing across the globe? The dataset is from my Data Visualization class. The analyses presented are a mix of what I've done in class and an addition of my take on exploring the data.
  - R
- [Cars Correlation](https://rpubs.com/zenrith/Cars_Correlation): If I wanted a car that was out of stock at the moment, could I find the next best alternative without knowing how to judge a car? 
  - R, Dimensionality reduction
- [lovoo EDA](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/lovoo%20EDA/lovoo_eda.ipynb): The romantically themed EDA that landed me my first internship. The goal was to explore the data and find out why some dating profiles possessed more likes than others. 
-  [STD in the US Storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeffrey7529/viz/STDintheUSstory/Story1): A storyboard on the STD situtation in the US based on a dataset. This was part of my final project for the [Data Visualisation With Tableau] course by UCDavis.
-  [STD in the US Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeffrey7529/viz/STDintheUSdashboard_16241118956390/STDcasesintheUS): A dashboard on the STD situtation in the US based on a dataset. This was part of my final project for the [Data Visualisation With Tableau] course by UCDavis.

## Machine Learning  
###### Here you can explore my work that involves building models to tackle different problems! They're performed in Python.
- In the [ames regression project](https://github.com/zenrith/ames-regression), I : 
    - Developed a regression model for the ames dataset. The model ranked around top 20% on the Kaggle leaderboard
    - Packaged and published the developed model on Pypi
    - Built an API to use the model as a service
    - Automated my building and testing with continuous integration
- [Fake News Detection](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/tree/main/Fake%20News%20Detection): In a modernizing society that rapidly generates content online, can we accurately tell fake from true news apart? This was a project from my school's Machine Learning class, NUS CS3244. My partner and I was in charge of doing the preparation / cleaning / modelling of data. Personally, I handled the modelling that involved TFIDF vectorization, while my partner did modelling that involved Word2Vec. 
  - EDA, Text Classification
- [High Dimensional Dataset Project](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Class%20Project%20-%20High%20Dimensional%20Dataset%20Regression/Report.pdf): What do we do when dimensions become very large? The curse of dimensionality inhibits model performance. However, we can deal with that problem using modified algorithms that mitigate this problem! This is a class project that deals with high dimensional data
- [Bike Regression](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Bike%20Sharing%20Regression/bike_regression_final.ipynb): This is a dataset taken from Kaggle, and serves as a way for me to apply what I've learned in class onto a real dataset. This project made me question much of my methodology and pushed me to google for many solutions online. It may be seen as an elementary dataset to deal with but it was a fruitful challenging experience for me. Took me 5 drafts to reach to this solution!
- [Cats And Dogs](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Cats%20And%20Dogs/Cats%20And%20Dogs.ipynb): One of the first few image classification models I made for an old Kaggle Challenge.
  - Binary image Classification
- [Horses vs Humans](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Horses%20vs%20Humans/Horses%20vs%20Humans.ipynb): My first transfer learning project!
  - Transfer Learning, Binary image classification
- [Hand Signs](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Hand%20signs/Hand%20Signs.ipynb): Automatically distinguish handsigns from one another. 
  - Multiclass image classification
- [Temperatures In Australia](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Temperatures%20In%20Australia/Temperatures%20in%20Australia.ipynb): Predicting for temperatures. My first time series project :). 
  - Time Series prediction
