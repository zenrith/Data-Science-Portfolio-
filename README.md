# Data Science Portfolio
A repository containing all my personal data science projects. You can find the Python .ipynb notebooks and R .Rmd files here. You may also visit [here](https://rpubs.com/zenrith) for my R portfolio.

Most, if not all, will contain some form of data cleaning, manipulation, visualization. Under each project, I'll just include techniques that separate ones one project from the other. If no additional techinques are included, then it's safe to assume that it's pretty must just cleaning, manipulation and visualization. 

Hope you can take something away from them!

## Python
- [Suicide And Economy](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Suicide%20And%20Economy/Suicide%20And%20Economy.ipynb): All societies have different problems. When things go wrong, some people end it for themselves. How does this phenomenon vary from society to society? FYI this was the first project I did so it might look a little rougher than the other projects
  - Techniques: Linear regression
- [Carousell Analytics](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/blob/main/Carousell%20Analytics/Carousell%20Analytics.ipynb): Ever wondered how Carousell is performing at a certain point in time? How would we know without a dataset? We create our own!
  - Techniques: Web scraping, Regression  
- [Fake News Detection](https://github.com/zenrith/Data-Science-Portfolio-/tree/main/Fake%20News%20Detection): In a modernizing society that rapidly generates content online, can we accurately tell fake from true news apart? This was a project from my school's Machine Learning class, NUS CS3244. My partner and I was in charge of doing the preparation / cleaning / modelling of data. Personally, I handled the modelling that involved TFIDF vectorization, while my partner did modelling that involved Word2Vec. 
  - Techniques: Text processing, Classification

## R 
- [Retail Trends](https://rpubs.com/zenrith/Retail_Trends): Can we see how a particular retail company is doing across the globe? The dataset is from my Data Visualization class. The analyses presented are a mix of what I've done in class and an addition of my take on exploring the data.


## Python and R (coming soon)
